<h1> Grounding</h1>
<p id="tribute-info"> HTML code defines the content of a webpage, while CSS defines the style of that content.
    There are two ways to add style to your webpage: either through inline CSS statements or using a CSS style block
at the beginning.
</p>
<h1>
    Important terms, tools, and concepts in CSS
</h1>
<ul>
    <li> inline = does not start on a new line and only takes up as much space as necessary;</li>
    <li>selectors = style attributes defined in the opening style block as follows: name of element without any brackets +
        style rules between curly brackets;</li>
    <li>class = reusable styles declared as: period (.) + name you want to give to the class + style attributes btw curly
        brackets;</li>
    <li>id attribute = specifies a unique id for an HTML element;</li>
        <ul>
            <li># = how you reference an id attribute inside the style element;</li>
            <li>giving the element an id for the sake of it = It's a good practice to assign labels that describe
                the function of the element.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>unordered list (<'ul'>) = a list in which the items are not numbered;</li>
    <li> item <'li'> = declares the following text to be a list item. !Yes, you have to type it for each list item
        like it was the Stone Age...!</li>
    <li> <'div> division element = a general purpose container for other elements; probably the most commonly used
        HTML element of all;</li>
    <li> image caption <'figcaption'> = text within the image element that is added as a caption to the image;</li>
    <li> <'a'> anchor element = an anchor is a piece of text which marks the beginning and / or the ened of a hypertext
        link;
        <ul>
            <li>'href' = an optional attribute that defines the network address;</li>
            <li> anchor text = a link needs a text that will become the link; it is plain text written in between
            <'a'> and <'/a'>;</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>'transform' property = changes the scale of an element;stated within the curly brackets;</li>
    <li> Responsive Web Design = the practice of designing flexible websites that can respond to different screen sizes,
        orientations and resolutions;
        <ul>
            <li>viewport = the user's visible area of a webpage, differing with each device;</li>
            <li>'max-width: 100%;' = the maximum size of the element relative to its container; at 100%, it is never
        wider than the container it is in;</li>
        <li> 'height: auto' = makes the element keep its original aspect ratio;</li>
            'display: flex' = allows you to use flex properties on an element to build a responsive page;
        </li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> CSS Box Model = each element is treated as its own box;
        <ul> <li> the normal flow of a document = the default layout of elements by which block-level items automatically
            start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content;</li>
            <li> 'position: relative;' = makes the position of the element relative to its current position
            in the natural flow (ex: 'bottom: 10px;');</li>
            <li> 'position: fixed' = it won't move when you scroll;</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li> 'display: grid;' = not really about creating a table on your page. More to do with manipulating CSS objects
        in relation to one another. After all, they are all boxes (see the above CSS Box Model concept), even if
        don't see the borders. Just create some borders and you can see the underlying layout.
        <ul>
            <li> adding rows and columns = 'grid-template-rows' and 'grid-template-columns';</li>
            <ul>
                <li>fr = sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space,</li>
                <li>auto: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically</li>
                <li>%: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container.</li></ul>
            <li>'container' = the parent element;</li>
            <li> 'items' = the children;</li>
            <li> 'justify-items' = aligns items (children) horizontally; takes the usual Ms Word values: left, center,
                right;</li>
            <li>'align-items' = aligns items (children) vertically; values are: start (top), center, end (bottom);</li>

        </ul></li>
    <li> borders = !Adding a border makes your boxes visible. It's like the print() function in Python.
        <ul><li>defining a border = border-color, border-width, border-style (ex: solid);</li></ul></li>
    <li>labels = The for attribute of <'label'> must be equal to the id attribute of the related element to bind them
        together. A label can also be bound to an element by placing the element inside the <'label'> element. </li>
    <li>dropdown menus = a div element having hte lass 'custom-select' and then you have the <'select'><'/select'>
        sub-element in it which, in turn, has <'option'><'/option'> sub-elements which are basically the dropdown menu
        options to choose from;</li>
    <li>radio buttons = you create a radio button as a special type of input, that is an input with the type="radio".
        !The thing to remember is that you have to group your radio buttons together so that if one is selected all the
        others are deselected. You do this by setting a name for each button (input line) and that name is the same
        for all buttons.
        <ul><li>value = if you don't assign a value to your radio button, the data it will send via the submit button is
            'on' for whatever the name of the group was set.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>textarea = text input from a user, but you can write as much text as you like. The syntax is as follows:
        <'textarea' cols="" rows=""><'/textarea'></li>
    <li>header = the header tag. It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag
        and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages. !Watch out! It is not the same
        thing as the 'head' element at the very top of an HTML, which contains the title of the page,
        meta information, etc. </li>
    <li>nav = a screen reader feature that wraps around the main navigation links on a page;</li>
    <li>internal links to a page = also with an anchor tag, <'a'>, only instead of an http link for href=,
        you assign the id of the element on the page being referenced</li>
    <li>padding = an element's padding controls the amount of space between the element's content and its border;
        for ex, when having a text inside a box, it's the space surrounding hte text right up to the border;</li>
    <li>margin = An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements;
        for ex, the space between a nested box and its container;
        <ul><li>adjusting the margin on each side = 'margin-bottom', 'margin-top', 'margin-left', 'margin-right';
        </li></ul></li>
    <li>form action="url" = where to send the data for the form;</li>
    <li>media query = adjust CSS features when the screen is less than or more than a certain size; command in CSS
        is '@media (min-height / etc) {}';</li>
    <li>adjust size of an element = 'height' 'width';</li>
